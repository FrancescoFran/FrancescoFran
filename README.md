# Francesco Loiudice

### Hi there

Passionate about technology and innovative solutions, my skills are mainly focused on SW/HW industrial automation, machine learning engineering, development/test/measurement laboratory management and international team management.

Naturally stimulated by the intellectual challenge and the desire to enrich myself, I am keen today to participate in socially useful and environmentally responsible stimulating projects by integrating artificial intelligence and other new technologies.
